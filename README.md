# VocabDefiner
This is a program that defines vocabulary words and puts them in sentences for you. This program only works on Unix-based systems.

This program was developed by Jack Hudson. Please note that he made this in two days while procrastinating his homework, so occasionally there may be bugs. If that occurs, please inform him so that he can fix them. Thanks! - Jack

Instructions:
1. Make sure your computer can run this code! (Hint: If it's a PC, then it probably can't!)
2. Edit the "words.txt" file to be a list of the vocabulary words you want to define. I've defaulted it to be a list of vocab words you can use to test the program.
3. Run the "definer.sh" file. It is a shell script, which means that it'll open up a little popup window that will do everything for you.
4. Your information will now be in the "definitions.txt" and "sentences.txt" files.
5. Profit!
